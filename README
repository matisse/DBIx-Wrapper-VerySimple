DBI/Wrapper version 0.01
========================

DBI::Wrapper is a simple module that provides a high-level interface
to the Perl DBI module. The provided methods are for fetching
a single record (returns a hash-ref), many records (returns
an array-ref of hash-refs), and for executing a non-select statement
(returns a result code).

The intention here is that your application will have much cleaner code, so instead of writing:

    my $sql = "SELECT name,address FROM $table WHERE zipcode=?";
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT name,address FROM $table WHERE zipcode=?");
    my $rv  = $sth->execute("$zipcode");
    my @found_rows;
    while ( my $hash_ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref ) {
        push( @found_rows, $hash_ref );
    }

You would write:

    my $sql = "SELECT name,address FROM $table WHERE zipcode=?";
    my $found_rows = $wrapper->FetchAll("$sql","$zipcode");
    # $found_rows is an array_ref of hash_refs
